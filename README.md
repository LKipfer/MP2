Mini Project Nr. 2: A Server for a ToDo-List
Programmer: Lukas Kipfer
Class: Software Engineering, BITPT19
Lecturer: Bradley Richards

Dear Bradley

Just as in my 1st mini-project, i have also decided to complete this task by myself in the hopes of learning as much as possible.
Unfortunately, i underestimated the scope of the project and despite the 30+ hours i have spent on it, i didn't manage to finish the program properly.

On one hand there were things i just didn't understand and on the other there were features that i didn't have the time to implement fully.
This was mostly because in order to implement them, i wanted to finish the "base" program first. I still included all features in the hopes to lose less points.

Here's a list:

Required Features that are implemented:
- The Client, Server and Message package are complete and contain all necessary classes. The client and server are fully able to communicate with eachother.
- The Server mostly answers with the same result message, but it also uses an error message and a goodbye message.
-

Partial or Missing Required Features:
- Methods for Checking User Inputs (passwordChecker, titleChecker, descriptionChecker, mailChecker) were provisionally implemented but not used. (Located at ServerThreadForClient)
- No CSS used, because edu-edition of Intellij apparently doesn't let me use my own CSS
- Messaging: I had troubles to implement the "|" as a separator. No matter what i tried, i always got an error message in return.
- Messaging: Results message currently includes ALL attributes, but correctly displays the one's it doesn't need with null. Didnt have time to implement loop for !=null attributes.

Additional Features:
+ Function for Saving to & Reading from file were provisionally implemented but not used. (Located at ServerThreadForClient)
+ Fully functional MVC for Server and Client.
+ (Partial) gave the token a random generated number, but didn't assign token to user

Should there be any questions about the program, please contact me via mail:

Thanks and best regards,
Lukas Kipfer
